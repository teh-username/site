Generating [flame graphs](http://www.brendangregg.com/flamegraphs.html) on containerized workloads requires a bit of fiddling around with reasons (and solutions) discussed thoroughly [here](https://blog.alicegoldfuss.com/making-flamegraphs-with-containerized-java/) and [here](http://www.batey.info/docker-jvm-flamegraphs.html). As the title suggests, we'll try to apply the methods above but modify it slightly to make it work in the context of workloads (scoped to Java-based applications) running inside a Kubernetes cluster.

## The "Workaround"

The entire idea is illustrated below:

```
 Kubernetes Node
 +-----------------------------------------------------------+
 |                  Docker Runtime                           |
 |                  +--------------------------------------+ |
 |                  |                      PID Namespace   | |
 |                  |                      +-------------+ | |
 | Host Path        |                      | +---------+ | | |
 | +-------------+  |                      | |   app   | | | |
 | |+-----------+|  |  +--------+          | +---------+ | | |
 | ||docker.sock||---->|profiler|-\        |      ^      | | |
 | |+-----------+|  |  +--------+  -\      |      |      | | |
 | +-------------+  |      ^         -\    |      |      | | |
 |                  |      |           -\  | +---------+ | | |
 |                  |      |             - ->| fg-perf | | | |
 |                  |      |               | +---------+ | | |
 |                  |      |               +-------------+ | |
 |                  |      |                      ^        | |
 |                  +------|----------------------|--------+ |
 |                         |                      |          |
 |                         |                      |          |
 |                         v                      v          |
 |                   +------------+           +-------+      |
 |                   |profiler pod|           |app pod|      |
 |                   +------------+           +-------+      |
 +-----------------------------------------------------------+
```

The way it works is as follows:

1. Spawn a "profiler" pod on the [same node](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/assign-pod-node/#nodeselector) where the pod we want to profile is scheduled. We also need to mount the host's `/var/run/docker.sock` <sup> [*] </sup> via [hostPath](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/#hostpath).

2. Via the "profiler" pod, run a container (using the `docker.sock` we mounted earlier) and explicitly set the PID Namespace to join the target pod's namespace via the [`--pid` flag](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#pid-settings---pid), e.g.

```
docker run -it --pid=container:<container_id> <perf-container-image>
```

3. Exec into the container you just created and perform the actual profiling:
    3.1 Run `perf` on PID 1 <sup> [**] </sup>.

    ```
    perf record -F 99 -a -g -p 1 -- sleep 60
    ```

    3.2 Generate mappings using [perf-map-agent](https://github.com/jvm-profiling-tools/perf-map-agent). More details [here](https://blog.alicegoldfuss.com/making-flamegraphs-with-containerized-java/#the-hack).

    ```
    java -cp attach-main.jar:tools.jar net.virtualvoid.perf.AttachOnce PID 1
    ```

    3.3 Generate the [Flame Graph](https://github.com/brendangregg/FlameGraph).

    ```
    perf script -f | FlameGraph/stackcollapse-perf.pl | FlameGraph/flamegraph.pl --color=java --hash > flamegraph.svg
    ```

    3.4 You may need to do a combination of `docker cp` and `kubectl cp` to get the generated flame graph out of the container and into your machine.

## Results

To make sure that everything is working accordingly, I created a [sample Spring Boot application](https://spring.io/guides/gs/spring-boot/) and then used [Christopher's sample code](http://www.batey.info/docker-jvm-flamegraphs.html) for comparison. Sure enough I got the following graph ([interactive version](mvYqvP6UPpWgN5X6.svg)):

Happy profiling!

[\*] [A big security risk](https://www.lvh.io/posts/dont-expose-the-docker-socket-not-even-to-a-container.html), tread carefully.
