Hello there! I'm LA and I write code (for a living and for fun).

I'm currently part of the Infrastructure Team under AWS EC2 KaOS (Kernel and Operating Systems). Do give my [Github](https://github.com/teh-username) page a visit to see what I'm working on.

You can reach me at hello(at)laroberto.dev
