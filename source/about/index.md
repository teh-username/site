Hey there! I'm LA and I write code (for a living and for fun).

I was previously a Full Stack Developer (CSS will always be magic to me) but I've made the jump to be a Site Reliability Engineer because infrastructure and all its problems appeal to me.

I'm currently neck deep in containerization technologies such as Docker and Kubernetes along with the biggest cloud platforms (AWS, GCP and Azure). Do give my [Github](https://github.com/teh-username) page a visit to see what else I'm doing.

A big fan of:

0. Infrastructure and Configuration as Code
1. Continuous Integration
2. Automating boring and manual stuff
3. Writing slick tests
4. Pushing performant code

I'm currently a Senior Site Reliability Engineer at ING BSS
