Hey there! I'm LA and I write code (for a living and for fun).

I'm a Full Stack Developer (but CSS will always be magic to me).

I speak Python, PHP and JavaScript mostly but I'm always learning new stuff everyday (I'm currently an amateur DevOps-ish guy).

A big fan of:

1. Continuous Integration
2. Automating boring and manual stuff
3. Writing slick tests
4. Pushing performant code

I'm currently a Software Engineer at Freelancer.com (the company)

You can reach me at:
