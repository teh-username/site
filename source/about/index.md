Hey there! I'm LA and I write code (for a living and for fun).

I'm currently a full-time Systems Engineer but was previously a Full Stack Developer (CSS will always be magic to me). I'm fascinated with the problem space of systems design which is why I made the jump.

I'm currently neck deep in containerization technologies such as Docker and Kubernetes along with the biggest cloud platforms (AWS, GCP, and Azure). Do give my [Github](https://github.com/teh-username) page a visit to see what else I'm doing.

A big fan of:

0. Pushing performant code
1. Writing slick tests
2. Automating boring and manual stuff
3. CI and CD
4. Infrastructure and Configuration as Code

You can reach me at hello(at)laroberto.dev
